     <p>Here are a few fun facts about me.  I am a fun loving cat lover.  I have 2 cats named Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin. Dean and I do yoga together in the mornings, you can find us on Instagram. I enjoy live music, especially music festivals.  I am very sad that Riot Fest was cancelled this year. The last show I went to was to see Deadmau5 at his show at Navy Pier in February</p> 
     <p>I love to cook, bake, travel, read, and write. I like wine, and I make it a mission to find good wines under $15.00.  If I find a really good wine under #10.00 I will get a case.   I like my morning coffee served with steamed milk, which is a habit I picked up from travelling.</p> 
    <p>My boyfriend likes to call me the ambassador of fun because I am always planning entertaining things to do. I especially enjoy attending sporting events.  I am a die hard Bears fan.  I also like the Blackhawks and the Bulls. My boyfriend and I enjoy headed out of town to catch a game somewhere.</p>
